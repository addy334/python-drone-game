ðŸ“‹ Project Plan
Here is the complete project broken down into phases, steps, and substeps. We will refer to these numbers going forward.

Phase 1: Project Foundation
Step 1.1: Setup Environment

Substep 1.1.1: Create project folder and Python virtual environment.

Substep 1.1.2: Install the pygame library.

Step 1.2: Create the Game Window

Substep 1.2.1: Write the initial main.py script to create a blank, closable window. (Completed)

Step 1.3: Create the Drone Physics Model

Substep 1.3.1: Write the initial drone.py script with the Drone class. (Completed)

Step 1.4: Integrate and Control Drone

Substep 1.4.1: Modify main.py to import, create an instance of, update, and draw the drone.

Substep 1.4.2: Modify main.py to handle key presses that call the drone's flap() method.

Phase 2: Core Gameplay Mechanics
Step 2.1: Create Obstacles

Substep 2.1.1: Create a game_elements.py file.

Substep 2.1.2: Write an Obstacle class that can manage its own position and movement.

Step 2.2: Manage Obstacles

Substep 2.2.1: Modify main.py to spawn Obstacle instances periodically.

Substep 2.2.2: Modify main.py to update and draw all active obstacles, removing ones that are off-screen.

Step 2.3: Implement Game Logic

Substep 2.3.1: Add collision detection between the drone and obstacles in main.py.

Substep 2.3.2: Create a simple "Game Over" state that freezes the game on collision.

Phase 3: Scoring and User Interface (UI)
Step 3.1: Implement Scoring

Substep 3.1.1: Write a Scoreboard class in game_elements.py to display text.

Substep 3.1.2: Modify main.py to detect when the drone successfully passes an obstacle and increase the score.

Step 3.2: Add Game Screens

Substep 3.2.1: Create a "Start Screen" that waits for player input to begin.

Substep 3.2.2: Enhance the "Game Over" screen to show the final score and offer a restart option.

Phase 4: Advanced Physics Features
Step 4.1: Add Wind Gusts

Substep 4.1.1: Modify the Drone class to periodically apply a horizontal force.

Step 4.2: Add Suspended Mass

Substep 4.2.1: Add pendulum physics logic to the Drone class in drone.py.

Substep 4.2.2: Calculate and apply the counter-force from the mass back onto the drone.

Substep 4.2.3: Modify main.py to visually render the rope and mass.

Phase 5: Final Polish
Step 5.1: Add Graphics and Sound

Substep 5.1.1: Create an assets/ folder for media files.

Substep 5.1.2: Replace all placeholder shapes with sprite images.

Substep 5.1.3: Add sound effects for flapping, scoring, and collisions.

Step 5.2: Refine and Balance

Substep 5.2.1: Tweak game difficulty (drone speed, obstacle frequency, etc.).

Substep 5.2.2: Implement multiple levels with increasing challenges as described in the vision.
