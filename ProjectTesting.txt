Of course. That's a great idea. Having a guide for tuning the game's parameters is essential for getting the "feel" just right.

Here is a developer's guide to testing and adjusting the core elements of your game.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Tuning Guide

This guide will show you which values to change to adjust the game's difficulty and feel, which file they are in, and what effect your changes will have.

### üöÄ Drone Physics (`drone.py`)

These values control how the drone feels to fly.

* **Gravity Strength**
    * **File:** `drone.py`
    * **Code:** `self.gravity = vec(0, 0.2)`
    * **What it Does:** Controls how quickly the drone falls.
    * **How to Tune It:**
        * **Increase** the value (e.g., to `0.3`) to make the drone fall **faster** and feel **heavier**. This makes the game harder and requires quicker reactions.
        * **Decrease** the value (e.g., to `0.1`) to make the drone fall **slower** and feel **floatier**. This makes the game easier.

* **Flap/Lift Strength**
    * **File:** `drone.py`
    * **Code:** `self.lift_force = -8`
    * **What it Does:** Controls the power of each flap.
    * **How to Tune It:** Remember, this is a negative number.
        * Make it **more negative** (e.g., to `-10`) for a **stronger**, higher jump with each flap.
        * Make it **less negative** (e.g., to `-6`) for a **weaker**, shorter jump, requiring more frequent tapping.

### üí® Wind Gusts (`drone.py`)

These values control the behavior of the wind.

* **Time Between Gusts**
    * **File:** `drone.py`
    * **Code:** `self.wind_timer = random.randint(180, 360)`
    * **What it Does:** Sets the "calm" period between gusts, measured in frames (60 frames = 1 second).
    * **How to Tune It:**
        * **Decrease** these numbers (e.g., `randint(120, 240)`) for **more frequent** wind.
        * **Increase** them for longer periods of calm.

* **Gust Duration**
    * **File:** `drone.py`
    * **Code:** `self.wind_duration = random.randint(60, 150)`
    * **What it Does:** Sets how long an active gust lasts, in frames.
    * **How to Tune It:**
        * **Increase** these numbers for **longer-lasting** wind, making it more challenging.
        * **Decrease** them for shorter, quicker bursts.

* **Gust Strength**
    * **File:** `drone.py`
    * **Code:** `strength = random.uniform(0.1, 0.25)`
    * **What it Does:** Sets the power of the sideways push.
    * **How to Tune It:**
        * **Increase** these numbers (e.g., `uniform(0.2, 0.4)`) for **stronger** wind that pushes the drone more forcefully.

### üß± Obstacle Properties (`game_elements.py`)

These values control the pipes themselves.

* **Obstacle Speed**
    * **File:** `game_elements.py`
    * **Code:** `self.speed = 5`
    * **What it Does:** Controls how fast the pipes scroll from right to left.
    * **How to Tune It:**
        * **Increase** this value to make the game **faster** and more difficult.
        * **Decrease** it to slow the game down.

* **Gap Size**
    * **File:** `game_elements.py`
    * **Code:** `self.gap_size = 200`
    * **What it Does:** The size of the vertical opening between the top and bottom pipes.
    * **How to Tune It:**
        * This is a primary difficulty control. **Decrease** the value (e.g., to `180`) to make the gap **smaller** and the game much harder.

* **Obstacle Dimensions**
    * You asked if the block dimensions are random. The **width is fixed**, but the **position of the gap is random**.
    * **File:** `game_elements.py`
    * **Code for Width:** `self.width = 80`. You can increase/decrease this to make pipes thicker or thinner.
    * **Code for Gap Position:** `self.gap_y = random.randint(gap_margin, ...)` controls the random vertical placement. The `gap_margin = 50` variable prevents the gap from spawning too close to the top or bottom of the screen. Increase the margin for an easier game.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Game Pacing (`main.py`)

This value controls the overall rhythm of the game.

* **Time Between Obstacles**
    * **File:** `main.py`
    * **Code:** `pygame.time.set_timer(ADD_OBSTACLE, 700)`
    * **What it Does:** Sets the time between when each new pipe set is created, in milliseconds. This controls the **horizontal distance** between obstacles.
    * **How to Tune It:**
        * **Decrease** this value (e.g., to `600`) to make pipes spawn **closer together**, increasing the difficulty.
        * **Increase** it to give the player more breathing room between pipes.
